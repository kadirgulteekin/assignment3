                    Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
                    incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others,
                    establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and
                    nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this
                    social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an
                    existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[19] When a rooster finds food, he may call other
                    chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping
                    the food. This behavior may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them
                    to eat
